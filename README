Building a test shared library for Android applications.

To build the most commond architectures, run make_tcs.sh to produce the
toolchains required.

Then to build shared libraries for each architecture, run
build_test_all_arch.sh. The resulting libraries end up in lib/ and the header
in include/.

To see how to include the library in an application, see hello-libs-external.

The libraries produced by build_test_all_arch.sh have been shown to work on
Android SDK 26 running on an aarch64 device.
